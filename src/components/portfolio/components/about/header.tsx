  'I started coding more than 10 years ago when the good old PHP and Double-clicking index.html was a thing. I then learned more advance languages like HTML (I am one of those who believe HTML is a Programming Language itself ðŸ˜‚), CSS, JavsScript, TypeScript, MySql and many more. I also spent my time learning some stuffs like Reactjs, Vuejs, Nextjs, Nodejs (especially Express), and a good amount of time diving Rest API. But my primary Language is Javascript (React/Nextjs) and PHP (Laravel) . I know GraphQL a little bit and I keep myself Up-to-Date with the information about the languages and technologies that I use. I claim myself to be one of those Fullstack Developer because I can do Front-end Design, good understanding of Rest API and how to connect both. By the way, I also know Laravel very well (incase you need a PHP Developer). I currently work in a leading tech company called Synergyse Tech. I work full time as Frontend Developer by using Nextjs as the main framework.'
